Alright. Step-by-step, and we start with the one thing ClawHub is **actually** judging:

## Step 1 — Rewrite `SKILL.md` so it’s **operational-first**

Right now your SKILL.md is still a spec. We’re going to turn it into a **runnable manifest** that an indie hacker can execute in minutes, and that the scanner can’t call “instruction-only.”

### What we’re adding (minimum to kill the alert)

* YAML frontmatter (machine-readable)
* Install + Run commands (explicit)
* Runtime endpoints list
* 90-second Quickstart (curl copy/paste)
* Env vars (demo vs clawshield)
* “What’s real today” (no false claims)
* Link to ClawShield SaaS upsell

## ✅ Replace your entire `SKILL.md` with this

# OpenExec — Governed Deterministic Execution (Skill)

OpenExec is a **runnable** governed execution service.  
It executes **only** what has already been approved.

It is not an agent.  
It is not a policy engine.  
It does not self-authorize.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Run (local)

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

---

## Endpoints

* `GET /` → must return 200 quickly (deployment health check)
* `GET /health` → health status
* `GET /ready` → readiness checks
* `GET /version` → version metadata
* `POST /execute` → execute an approved action deterministically
* `POST /receipts/verify` → verify receipt hash integrity

---

## Modes

### 1) Demo mode (default, free)

No external governance required. Useful for indie hackers.

```bash
export OPENEXEC_MODE=demo
```

Demo mode still enforces:

* deterministic execution
* replay protection (nonce/action hash)
* receipt generation

### 2) ClawShield mode (production / business)

Requires a **signed approval artifact** issued by ClawShield.
OpenExec verifies the signature offline using the ClawShield public key.

```bash
export OPENEXEC_MODE=clawshield
export CLAWSHIELD_PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- ... -----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
export CLAWSHIELD_TENANT_ID="tenant-id"
export CLAWSHIELD_BASE_URL="https://clawshield.forgerun.ai"
```

If signature validation fails → execution is denied.

## 90-Second Quickstart (Demo)

1. Start server:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

2. Confirm health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

3. Execute a deterministic demo action:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action":"echo",
    "payload":{"msg":"hello"},
    "nonce":"unique-1"
  }'
```

4. Replay attempt (should be denied):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action":"echo",
    "payload":{"msg":"hello"},
    "nonce":"unique-1"
  }'
```

---

## Receipts

Every execution attempt produces a receipt hash.
Receipts are **evidence**, not logs.

Verify a receipt hash:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/receipts/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receipt_hash":"<hash>"}'
```

---

## What this skill does

* Accepts structured execution requests
* Enforces replay protection
* Executes deterministically (approved parameters only)
* Emits verifiable receipts for every attempt
* In ClawShield mode: verifies **signed approvals** before execution

## What this skill does not do

* Define policy
* Grant permissions
* Reason autonomously
* Override governance decisions
* Self-authorize execution

---

## Architecture context (3-layer separation)

* **OpenExec** — deterministic execution adapter (this skill)
* **ClawShield** — governance + approval minting (SaaS): [https://clawshield.forgerun.ai/](https://clawshield.forgerun.ai/)
* **ClawLedger** — witness ledger (optional integration)

Each layer is replaceable. No single layer can act alone.

```

## Step 2 (after you paste this into the repo)
We will update the README to mirror the same “runnable first” story.

But first: **do Step 1 only**.

### Your move now
1) Replace `SKILL.md` with the block above  
2) Tell me once it’s saved in Replit

Then we go to Step 2.

Yes — but with a boundary.

Opus can execute the **mechanical Git steps inside Replit**, but it cannot:

* Log into your GitHub account outside Replit
* Confirm repository visibility
* Approve OAuth permissions
* Decide release strategy

So we’ll use Opus for the deterministic, mechanical Git operations — and you remain the authority for final push + verification.

That keeps sovereignty intact.

# 🧠 What We Want Opus To Do

We want Opus to:

1. Amend the last commit message cleanly
2. Verify branch and remote
3. Ensure working tree is clean
4. Push `main` to origin
5. Tag `v0.1.0`
6. Push tag
7. Confirm push success

No interpretation.
No rewriting code.
No architectural changes.
Pure Git mechanics.

# 🔥 Give This Exact Prompt To Opus

Copy this verbatim:

## 🔧 GIT CANONICALIZATION TASK — DO NOT MODIFY CODE

We are finalizing OpenExec for canonical GitHub publication.

You must perform the following Git operations inside the current repository.

⚠️ Do NOT modify any source files.
⚠️ Do NOT change code.
⚠️ Only perform Git operations.
⚠️ If a command fails, report exact error output.

---

### Step 1 — Verify Current Branch

Run:

```
git branch
```

Confirm we are on `main`.

If not, switch:

```
git checkout main
```

---

### Step 2 — Amend Latest Commit Message

Amend the most recent commit message to:

```
Finalize OpenExec constitutional execution engine with signed approval validation and replay protection
```

Use:

```
git commit --amend -m "Finalize OpenExec constitutional execution engine with signed approval validation and replay protection"
```

---

### Step 3 — Verify Clean Working Tree

Run:

```
git status
```

Confirm:

* On branch main
* Nothing to commit
* Working tree clean

---

### Step 4 — Push Main Branch

Run:

```
git push origin main
```

If force required due to amend, use:

```
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

Only use force-with-lease if necessary.

Report exact output.

---

### Step 5 — Create Version Tag

Create tag:

```
git tag v0.1.0
```

Then push tag:

```
git push origin v0.1.0
```

---

### Step 6 — Confirm Push

Run:

```
git log --oneline -5
git tag
```

Return output.

Do not perform any other actions.

---

# 🧠 Why This Is Safe

We are using:

```
--force-with-lease
```

NOT raw `--force`.

That protects against overwriting remote unexpectedly.

---

# 🛑 What Opus Should NOT Do

* Do not rebase
* Do not squash
* Do not alter history beyond amend
* Do not rewrite files
* Do not generate new commits
* Do not touch secrets

---

# 🎯 After Opus Finishes

You personally verify on:

[https://github.com/trendinghot/openexec-skill](https://github.com/trendinghot/openexec-skill)

Confirm:

* Latest commit message clean
* Files present
* Tag visible

Then we proceed to:

ClawHub re-submission strategy.

# 🧠 One Important Question

Before you run this:

Do you want:

* `v0.1.0` as initial constitutional release?
* Or `v0.2.0` since signature layer was added?

Technically, since this is the first constitutional release:

I recommend:

```
v0.1.0
```

Keep semantic space for future enhancements.

Go ahead and give Opus that Git-only prompt.

When it finishes, paste the terminal output here.

We’ll audit it before moving forward.

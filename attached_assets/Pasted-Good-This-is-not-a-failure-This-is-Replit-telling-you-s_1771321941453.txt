Good.

This is not a failure.
This is Replit telling you something very specific.

Let’s break this down calmly.

---

# 🔴 What Actually Failed

Replit promotion failed because:

1. Health checks hit `/`
2. Your app either:

   * Isn’t starting with uvicorn properly
   * Isn’t binding to the correct port
   * Isn’t responding on `/`
   * Or isn’t listening on `0.0.0.0`

Replit production requires:

* App must bind to `0.0.0.0`
* App must bind to `port 5000`
* `/` must return 200 immediately

Right now one of those is wrong.

---

# 🧠 The Root Cause (From Your Screenshot)

Replit is explicitly telling you:

> The run command is wrong
> It’s not using uvicorn correctly
> It’s not binding to port 5000

This is the problem.

---

# ✅ The Fix (Do This Exactly)

Go to:

Replit → Settings → Run Command

Change it to:

```
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Do NOT use:

```
uvicorn main:app
```

Do NOT use:

```
python main.py
```

Must be exactly:

```
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

---

# 🧱 Next: Fix Your `/` Endpoint (Just in Case)

Open `main.py`.

Make sure you have this:

```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"service": "OpenExec", "status": "running"}
```

No database calls.
No slow operations.
No external calls.

Must return instantly.

---

# 🧪 Optional: Add Explicit Health Endpoint

Also add:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

---

# 🔄 After That

1. Save.
2. Republish.
3. Wait for autoscale.
4. Watch logs.

It should pass health check within 5–10 seconds.

---

# 🧠 Why This Happened

Replit autoscale works like this:

* Deploy container
* Send GET /
* Expect 200
* Expect response under timeout
* If not → fail

Your app probably:

* Wasn’t bound to port 5000
* Or wasn’t started with uvicorn correctly

This is a deployment config issue.
Not a code issue.

---

# ⚠️ Important Rule for Replit Production

FastAPI apps must:

* Use uvicorn
* Bind to 0.0.0.0
* Bind to port 5000
* Have immediate `/` response

Every time.

---

# 🎯 What This Means Strategically

Good news:

* Build works
* Security scan works
* Bundle works
* Only runtime config is wrong

That’s mechanical, not architectural.

---

# 🚀 Do This Now

Update run command.
Republish.
Tell me what logs show next.

We are stabilizing runtime layer before touching ClawHub again.

Let’s fix this cleanly.
